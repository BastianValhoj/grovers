# Grover's algorithm
A project for implementing grovers algorithm.
Made in collaboration by: A. Nymand, A. Rudfeld, J. Winther

Here is a short tutorial for how to use the repo (or you can download the `project` folder and use in your own virtual environment).

### 1. Clone Git repo

Navigate to your desired location and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BastianValhoj/grovers.git
cd 10384_QI
```

### 2. Create and activate a venv
This requires that you have installed the `uv` python dependecy manager.
```bash
uv sync
```
### 3. Project file
The notebook [`grovers_algorithm.ipynb`](project/grovers_algorithm.ipynb) shows
1. a detailed walktrough of simulating Grover's algorithm.
2. an optimzed function calculating the iterations. 
3. plotting vectors in 2D and barplot.
